    Situation: In the NICU, the dietitians' job is to calculate the pre-term infants' diet (i.e. caloric & micronutrient intake) based on the babies' weight and anemic status. In our NICU, these diets were being calculated manually which made them extremely error-prone and time-consuming (it was one dietitian's full time job to do all these calculations manually!).

<p>Task: I saw that we needed to automate this because the diet calculations were incorrect and our NICU babies were not getting the proper nutrition they needed!</p>

<p>Action: I created a pre-term infant diet calculator in Excel. I included a maco button that takes a screenshot of the results so that it can be easily inserted into the patient's chart.</p>

<p>Results: I saved the unit 40 hours of work a week (or $50,000 annually). Also, our pre-term infants were getting their proper nutrition which led to better clinical outcomes!</p>
